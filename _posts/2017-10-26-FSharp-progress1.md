Some new knowledge from F# world.

Book
----

I've bought a [book](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional) from great Scott Wlaschin. I's a beta publication, but I didn't want to wait for the final publication. The book covers some DDD theory and of course F# interpretation. 
There are some advanced stuff like functors etc. but of course in disguise. I hope my next business system I'll write in F#.
