Theory - enough. Let's write some real stuff. I think it will be a software calculating votes using [STV method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote).
<!-- more -->
New project:

```
dotnet new console -lang f# -n Multidata.Stv
```

In other folder unit test project:

```
dotnet new xunit -lang f#
```

As I use Visual Studio Code with [ionide-fsharp](http://ionide.io/) I add the main project reference to the xunit project. It is as easy as editing .fsproj file:

```
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\Multidata.Stv\Multidata.Stv.fsproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Ok.
Let's build some models..

```F#
module Multidata.Stv.StvModels

type Candidate = {
    candidateId: int;
    name: string
}

type Ballot = int list // candidate in order of preference

type Poll = { 
    numberOfSeats: int;
    candidates: Candidate list
}

type PollResultItem = {
    candidateId: int;
    numberOfVotes: int;
    elected: bool;
}

// --- temporary types

type AggregatedVote = {ballot: Ballot; numberOfVotes: int}
```

I put them in separate module. Types above are the second version of models. In the beginning I made *Ballot* more complicated:

```F#
type VoteItem = {
    candidateId: int;
    preference: int
}

type Ballot = VoteItem list
```

But of course all code dealing with that was far more complicated. Now *Ballot* is just a list of candidate ids ordered by preference. By the way code refactoring was astonishing easy.

So:
*Candidate* type represents, well... candidate.
*Ballot* is a list of chosen candidates by the voter.
*Poll* represents one polling event - it describes number of seats to be taken and list of candidates
*PollResultItem* list of that will be a result of calculations.

I've also added *AggregatedVote* so it is an aggregation of each *Ballot* variations.
