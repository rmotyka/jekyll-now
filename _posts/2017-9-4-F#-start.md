Now I'm about to learn some F# stuff. I've got strong C# background, but I'm quite curious if I can write more reliable code using F#...

I know the F# performance is not as great as C#, but often reliability is more important than that.

I've also decided to write some blog about my progress in learning. First because it is beneficial to make some notes during learning and second because there is still not very large amount of F# resources so I might help someone maybe..
