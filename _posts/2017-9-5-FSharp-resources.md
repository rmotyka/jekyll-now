Learning resources
==================

There are some resources which I use to learn F#:

1. <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com> - it is a great site and my primary source
1. <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/> - it should be the primary source
1. The book "Expert F#" IV edition <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1484207416> which I've bought in Polish: <https://helion.pl/ksiazki/f-4-0-dla-zaawansowanych-wydanie-iv-don-syme-adam-granicz-antonio-cisternino,f4zaa4.htm>

That's all. It might be not a large list, but I prefer to learn while typing.
