I've finally managed to finish the program. It works as a basic, standard STV calculator.
It calculates aggregated ballot list and then in several steps it removes winners and/or losers.

In spreadsheet it looks like that:

|       |    |      | 
|-------|----|------| 
| quota | 20 |      | 
|       |    |      | 
| step 1|    |      | 
| 16    | 24 | 17   | 
| A     | A  | D    | 
| B     | C  | A    | 
| C     | B  | B    | 
| D     | D  | C    | 
|       |    |      | 
| step 2|    |      | 
| 8     | 12 | 17   | 
| B     | C  | D    | 
| C     | B  | B    | 
| D     | D  | C    | 
|       |    |      | 
| step 3|    |      | 
| 8     | 12 | 17   | 
| C     | C  | D    | 
| D     | D  | C    | 
|       |    |      | 
|       |    | 17   | 
| D     | D  | D    |
